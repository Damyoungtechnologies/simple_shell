.SH NAME
.B simple_shell
- A C-based simple shell developed for interaction with Linux operating systems.

.SH SYNOPSIS
 hsh [options] [file]

.SH DESCRIPTION
In UNIX terminology, a shell serves as the interactive user interface for an operating system, functioning as the layer that interprets and executes user-entered commands, often known as a command interpreter. A shell is typically associated with a command syntax.

.B Overview

The simple shell processes lines from a file or terminal, interprets them, and executes various commands. It initiates when a user logs into the system, providing features for interactive use. One notable advantage is its shared interpretative language for both interactive and non-interactive scenarios, enabling direct command input or script execution from a file.

.SH Return Value

The return value is consistently 0 for success, while any other number indicates failure.

.SH PATH

The simple shell scans all directories specified in the PATH environment variable for executables.

.SH OPTIONS
.B simple_shell
Command options are appended after the main command, separated by a space and a '-' symbol.

.SH EXAMPLE

[command] [options]
$ ls -l

.SH BUGS
A single space must follow each argument.
